A distribution is a way to show how data points are spread across possible values.
Uniform Distribution: Every value within a range has the same probability.
Normal Distribution: Also known as a bell curve; most values cluster around the mean with symmetric tails. Often used in real-world data.
Binomial Distribution: Used for discrete outcomes with two possibilities.
Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval.

Mean
The mean is a measure of central tendency, representing the "center" of a data set.
Types of Means:
Arithmetic Mean: The regular average.
Weighted Mean: When some values contribute more to the mean than others.
