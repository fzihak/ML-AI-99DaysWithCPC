Comments
Use # for single-line comments.
For multiple lines, use triple quotes """ ... """.

Variables
No need to declare a type; just assign with =.
Example: name = "Alice" or age = 25.
Data Types

Common types: int, float, str, list, dict.
Python is dynamically typed, so types donâ€™t need to be specified.
Indentation

Indentation (4 spaces) is used to define blocks of code.
Important: Consistent indentation is crucial since it replaces {} brackets.
